Hi there,

Here's a copy of your SkinMatch routine roadmap:

Primary concerns: acne-breakouts
Secondary concerns: hyperpigmentation
Eye area concerns: dark-circles
Skin type: combination
Sensitivity: yes
Budget preference: mid

Ingredients to prioritise: Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA), Zinc PCA

Strategy notes:
 • AM: Gentle cleanse, hydrating essence, then lightweight moisturizer.
 • PM: Double cleanse (oil then gel), BHA treatment (1-2x/wk), then moisturizer.
 • Alternate BHA with LHA treatment nights for gentle exfoliation.
 • Apply thinner serums/essences *before* thicker creams for absorption.
 • Niacinamide serum before moisturizer can help with oil control & hyperpigmentation.
 • Use a calming moisturizer (Panthenol, Green Tea) after actives to soothe skin.
 • Hyaluronic Acid essence on damp skin locks in moisture.
 • Sunscreen is crucial AM! Reapply throughout the day to prevent hyperpigmentation.
